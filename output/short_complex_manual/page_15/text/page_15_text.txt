2.1 REPLACEMENT PARTS AND WARRANTY INFORMATION

Before ordering parts or initiating service inquiries, make note of the machine serial number. The machine serial number plate ( 1 ) is located on the frame behind the left front tire.

Note: The replacement of any part on this machine with any other than factory authorized replacement parts can adversely affect the performance, durability, or safety of the machine, and will void the warranty. JLG disclaims liability for any claims or damages, whether regarding property damage, personal injury or death arising out of the use of unauthorized replacement parts.

A warranty registration form must be filled out by the local JLG dealer.

Registration activates the warranty period and helps to assure that warranty claims are promptly processed to guarantee full warranty service.
